a proxy server, retrieves data on the internet, on behalf of the user
benefits:  privacy: invisible IP address
           speed : cache database and saving bandwidth
           activity logging (in  a company)

we would be developing a simple multi-threaded proxy server capable of handling HTTP traffic.
mostly based on the basic socket programming ideas.

1. creating an incoming socket
2. accept client and process
once a successful connection is made, we dispatch the request in a separate thread,
making ourselves available for the next request.
This allows us to handle multiple requests simultaneously which boosts the performance of the server multifold times.
3. redirecting the traffic:
- we extract the URL from the received request data.
- we find the destination address of the request. Address is a tuple of (destination_ip_address, destination_port_no).
We will be receiving data from this address.
