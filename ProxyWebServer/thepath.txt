a proxy server, retrieves data on the internet, on behalf of the user
benefits:  privacy: invisible IP address
           speed : cache database and saving bandwidth
           activity logging (in  a company)

we would be developing a simple multi-threaded proxy server capable of handling HTTP traffic.
mostly based on the basic socket programming ideas.
